## Pier’s Home Rehab Task List

## Summary

Pier’s Home Rehab is a detailed task list of DIY projects Pier has to complete during the initial phase of home renovation. Once selected, each task displays a description, and the tools and materials required to complete the task. The user can add any additional tools and materials needed to their respective lists. A photo gallery documents progress with before, during, and after photographs. 

## MVP

The MVP contains one page with four features:

1) A drop-down menu of existing tasks with an 'add task' button that allows the user to view the details of a selected task.
2) A ‘task list’ box to contain descriptions of each task once added, and an input field to add notes.
3) A ‘tools needed’ box to contain the tools and quantities needed for each task once the task is selected. This box also contains an input field to add tools.
4) A ‘materials needed’ box to contain the materials and quantities needed for each task once the task is selected. This box also contains an input field to add materials.

## Product Roadmap

The existing tasks are prioritized in the current phase of Pier's rehab project, but additional tasks and their descriptions will be added on the back-end as this renovation progresses. As the project progresses, additional photos documenting the work will also be added.
